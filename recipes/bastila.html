        Bastila is a delicious Moroccan pastry, often filled with spiced chicken
        or pigeon, almonds, and eggs, wrapped in thin layers of dough and then
        baked until golden. It’s a perfect blend of savory and sweet flavors.

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot, cook the chicken with onion, garlic, ginger, cinnamon,
          saffron (if using), salt, pepper, and enough water to cover the
          chicken. Simmer for 45 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken, shred the meat, and set it aside. Reserve the
          cooking liquid and reduce it to a thick sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a pan, sauté the shredded chicken with cilantro and a bit of olive
          oil. Add the reduced cooking sauce to the chicken mixture. Let it cook
          for a few minutes until the flavors meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate pan, scramble the beaten eggs and cook them until just
          set, then mix them into the chicken mixture along with the chopped
          almonds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place a layer of phyllo dough in a
          pie pan, brushing each sheet with olive oil. Spoon the chicken mixture
          into the center.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold the dough over the filling, layering more sheets of phyllo dough,
          brushing each one with olive oil, and folding over the edges to seal
          the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 30–40 minutes, until the phyllo dough is golden brown and
          crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once out of the oven, sprinkle powdered sugar and cinnamon on top.
          Serve warm and enjoy!
