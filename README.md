# odin-recipes
Welcome to my very first project from The Odin Project! 🚀 This simple recipe website was built using pure HTML 🧱 to practice the basics of web structure and content layout. The goal was to get comfortable with using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and images. 📚 The site features a homepage and multiple recipe pages 🍽️, each showcasing a delicious dish. This project marks the beginning of my exciting journey into web development 💻 — many more projects to come! ✨
